# CCA Interaction Design Program

### IXDSN 2500-1 - Prototyping
Tue/Fri | 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM
San Francisco - Main Building - N15

Course Fee $0


Description

This course will introduce and explore prototyping from all aspects relevant to interaction design. Prototyping tools will be introduced from low fidelity to high including sketching to digital to interactive. Prototyping methods and mindset will be introduced. Students will also be introduced to meta-learning, a critical capacity to keep up and evolve as tools and processes do. Finally students will learn basic evaluative techniques to be ready to go out and learn from the world how effective their designs are and how to evolve and improve their designs.

### IXDSN 3000-1 - IxD 3: Objects and Space
Tue/Thu | 12:00 PM - 3:00 PM
San Francisco - Main Building - E5

Course Fee $50

Description

In Interaction Design Studio 3, students learn to apply their growing repertoire of design skills to the world of real tangible objects and spaces where embedded sensors, displays and actuators are involved, from small scale objects to large-scale environments. This is a built on the methods and sensibilities from screen-based interaction modalities, while liberating interactions into the physical world. Many new challenges will be addressed - the theoretical, strategic, and tactical lessons that students have been learning will evolve and extend to work in these new situations. The students' will work to develop an expanded personal perspective, without losing sight of people and their needs. The roles of sensing the environment and people's actions in it, the use of actuators and system agency, and new indications of system state will explored with an intention of deep understanding. A series of explorations will be undertaken to establish and exercise a command of the potential that these systems represent. The student will learn to produce simple prototypes using LCD screens, buttons and haptic components and other elements limited only by the student's imagination and resources. This course includes basic information on sensor technology and electronics. Group projects will be employed to bring the students onto a level playing field in terms of familiarity with the various making skills required for work of this sort. A large-scale project, done in groups, is intended to push on the students' collaboration skills. The course required prerequisites are programing and physics with electronics.
